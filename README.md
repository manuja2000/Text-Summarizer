# Text-Summarizer

Automatic text summarization using Extractive method.
Extraction-based Summarization: The extractive approach involves picking up the most important phrases and lines from the documents. It then combines all the important lines to create the summary. So, in this case, every line and word of the summary actually belongs to the original document which is summarized.

## Motivation

Internet is becoming very widely and easily available these days. More and more number of users are getting added day by day. This has caused the amount of content to rise up significantly. Text content is available in very large amounts and one can spend hours on reading and analyzing the text. Text summarization is very essential and required now more than ever.

Most natural language processors(NLPs) seem to use heavy machine learning models to summarize a text document. We explore some better text summarization methods which are less memory intensive and can perform this simple task without using machine learning.

# Project Goal

Text content is available in very large amounts and one can spend hours on reading and analyzing the text. Text summarization is very essential and required now more than ever.
While investigating reports, outlines make the determination procedure simpler. Also reduces reading time, accelerates the process of researching for information, and increases the amount of information that can Ô¨Åt in an area..
