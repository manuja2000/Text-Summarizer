## Motivation
Internet is becoming very widely and easily available these days. More and more number of users are getting added day by day. This has caused the amount of content to rise up significantly. Text content is available in very large amounts and one can spend hours on reading and analyzing the text. Text summarization is very essential and required now more than ever.

Most natural language processors(NLPs) seem to use heavy machine learning models to summarize a text document. We explore some better text summarization methods which are less memory intensive and can perform this simple task without using machine learning.
